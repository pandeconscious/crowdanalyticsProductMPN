*5000 clusters, with 2000 features seems to be doing a good job (running time around 1 hr) , 
the only problem that may occur sometimes is that clusters sometimes may be formed on the basis
of words that are not talking about the brand, e.g. "Metal Wall Hanging" is common among a cluster
instead of the exact brand

*But it seems mpns are more correlated to product types than brands

*Sometimes the mpn exists as conjugation with something else, e.g id 12 in train:
12,(Ship from USA) 3 Piece Bar Table Set in Gloss White with 2 Bar Stools by Coaster 100167-120356 /ITEM NO#8Y-IFW81854151906,(Ship from USA) 3 Piece Bar Table Set in Gloss White with 2 Bar Stools by Coaster 100167-120356 /ITEM NO#8Y-IFW81854151906,100167

*Sometimes, extra character on left or right, e.g in id 41 in train:
41,"Artists' Watercolor Paint Tube Capacity: Half, Color: Raw Umber","0101554 Capacity: Half, Color: Raw Umber Features: -Made individually to the highest standards. -Also great for traveling and sketching works. -Watercolor paint tube. -Maximum color strength offers greater tinting possibilities. -Tubes are more popular for those who use high volumes of color or stronger washes of color. -Pans are often used by beginners because they can be less inhibiting and easier to control the strength of color.

That extra character could just be comma or # as well:
53,"Robot Coupe 102391, (D) Magnetic Switch R6Vn Serie",(D) Magnetic Switch R6Vn Serie.,102391

*surrounding parentheses very common 
*following comma very common

*some characters are not present in any of the training set mpns e.g. , ;  - such characters need to be trimmed from potential mpns in test

*total 70 distinct chars present but at first position only 58 out of those characters are present

* 929 mnps in train have english words of len more than 3 in them as substring
    but only 11 mpns are them selves entirely english words (these 11 are noise)
    the other 929 have english embedded inside them
    
    so if a word in title or description is entirely english then we shoudldn't consider such words
    as potential mpns
